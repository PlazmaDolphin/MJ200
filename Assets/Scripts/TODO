PLACING BLOCKS:
- [X] Make a grid system, toggling visible overlay when E is pressed
- In grid mode, highlight block that mouse is on, restricted to a "placing radius"
- Highlighting changes to a 1x2 area, rotated vertically when pressing R
- Place a 1x2 block permanently using left click while in grid mode
- Restrict placing to areas that do not have other walls, items, piles, enemies, or the player
  - If a restricted area is highlighted with the mouse, highlight it in red
- Add support for 2x2 block (turret)?

[FOR CHRIZ]: Fix the layering when objects are close
- Ex. If player comes in from top, wall should show
    - If player comes in from bottom, player should show
    - Left side: player shows, Right side: wall shows
- Apply to all objects (ground scrap, enemies, player, piles, etc)
