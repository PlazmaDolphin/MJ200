PLACING BLOCKS:
[BASE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE]

[FOR CHRIZ]: Fix the layering when objects are close
- Ex. If player comes in from top, wall should show
    - If player comes in from bottom, player should show
    - Left side: player shows, Right side: wall shows
- Apply to all objects (ground scrap, enemies, player, piles, etc)
- Possible Solution: Split close and far side into different sprites, when assembling, one gets higher z-value?
