PLACING BLOCKS:
[BASE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE]

[FOR CHRIZ]: Fix the layering when objects are close
- Ex. If player comes in from top, wall should show
    - If player comes in from bottom, player should show
    - Left side: player shows, Right side: wall shows
- Apply to all objects (ground scrap, enemies, player, piles, etc)
- Possible Solution: Split close and far side into different sprites, when assembling, one gets higher z-value?

PLAYER WEAPONS:
[MELEE, GUN, AND GRENADE COMPLETE]
-    - [OPTIONAL]: Bullet goes through player walls,
-      but only for a short range (like peeking over and shooting)
-  - [Could leave for CHRIZ]: ammo reloading (takes 6? shots per clip, reloads cost scrap)
-  [OPTIONAL] Player weapons can damage walls

POLICE AI:
[BASIC FUNCTIONS]
- Use NavMesh to find a path to the player
-   Navigate around walls
-   Update the mesh upon each block placement
- If no path can be found:
-   [BASIC]: Move in straight line to player, break walls in the way
-     - Give police attack
-     - Give walls a health bar
-     - Walls properly deleted when health = 0
-   [MEDIUM]: Find minimum number of wall breaks needed to reach player
-     - Target thinnest part of wall
-     - Do not reevaluate until target wall is broken
-     - [OPTIONAL] Prioritize breaking low-health walls
[ADVANCED FUNCTIONS]:
- Give Police different AI strategies / classes?
-   1. Targets player (fast, low damage)
-   2. Targets walls  (slow, high damage)
-   3. Targets machines (medium speed and damage)
-   Priorities will progress upwards
-     Ex. if no machines, machine AI targets walls
-         if no machines or walls, machine AI targets player
-   If player has open path and in proximity, always target player
- [OPTIONAL]: Catapult class flings Type 1 AIs over the wall
